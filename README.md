## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The process starts from the Appilot Dashboard, where the user selects the Threads account(s) and analysis mode (e.g., demographic mapping or engagement segmentation).  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot runs the automation on a connected Android device, using UI Automator to navigate follower lists and collect profile metadata (bio, name, region, interactions).  
3. **AI Processing** â€” Collected data passes through demographic classification models that estimate age, gender, and interest categories.  
4. **Output or Action** â€” Generates visual demographic charts, heatmaps, and exports insights to the dashboard or local reports.  
5. **Other Functionalities** â€” Includes retry handling, logging, and proxy rotation to ensure consistent performance across large-scale accounts.
